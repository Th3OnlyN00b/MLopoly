# MLopoly

Please note this project does not use ML in any way, this is simply a catchy name.

This project is an implementation of Monopoly based in C#, with a solved AI which plays based on an algorithm which was obtained 
by statistically solving Monopoly. If you're ever playing alone, on average, the red spaces have the highest yield-cost.
